2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0 input auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0 input auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0 input manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0 input manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0 output auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0 output manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0 multiplier stage auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/multiplierUnit/out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0 multiplier stage manual_t/the_alu/multiplierUnit/out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/io_seg_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell auto_t/alu_tester/multiplierFSM/io_seg_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
